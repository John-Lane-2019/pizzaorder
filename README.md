# Pizza Order

This is the first assignment I did that involved building a GUI, in this case with Windows Forms. The whole purpose of this one was to begin teaching us the fundamentals of 
classes, objects, encapsulation, and pointers. The application creates controls dynamically after you enter the quantity of pizzas, then you can click on each of the buttons
that was created dynamically to switch between pizza orders.
